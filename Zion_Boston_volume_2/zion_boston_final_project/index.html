<h4><strong><p>There are many PC and Console games that have certain release dates for updates. Sometimes the release dates come late because its difficult for the makers to send the updates to the players games and consoles and PC's. The reason why they creators start with the PC's is because they get the latest new updates. The PC games also get extra new content added to them so that the game could be more enjoyable. Console games and systems are way different from the PC. Console games get the late updates because the games get updated every once a year. Even though you could play console games on an xbox on a TV screen, The PC games could have better improvements because its on an up to date computer. One of my favorite games that is on PC and console is Terraria. One of my friends from middle school got me into the game and it seemed really cool. Terraria is not a popular game these days because many gamers don't really like it. Terraria is one of the games that get the older updates on the console verson and the PC verson gets the up to date updates. This is one of the reasons why gamers play more computer games than console games. I play the PC verson of Terraria because I think it is faster than the console too.</p></strong></h4>
